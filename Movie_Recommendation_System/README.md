# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommender System** that suggests movies based on the similarity of content features such as genres, cast, crew, and plot overviews.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Objective**: Recommend top 5 similar movies to a given movie using a content-based filtering approach.

**Workflow**:

```
Dataset â†’ Preprocessing â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Vectorization â†’ Similarity Computation â†’ Recommendation
```

---

## ðŸ§  Recommender System Types

1. **Content-Based Filtering** â€“ Focuses on movie features (used in this project).
2. **Collaborative Filtering** â€“ Based on user similarity.
3. **Hybrid Systems** â€“ Combine both approaches.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used

**Source**: [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

* `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains cast and crew info.
* `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains movie metadata like genres, keywords, overviews, etc.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

Selected columns:

* `movie_id`, `title`, `overview`, `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, `crew`

Transformations:

* Extract top 3 cast members.
* Extract director from crew.
* Convert lists from string to actual Python lists.
* Merge all features into a single `tags` column.
* Apply **stemming** to normalize words.

---

## ðŸ§® Vectorization & Similarity

* Used **Bag of Words** model via `CountVectorizer` (top 5000 frequent words).
* Removed stop words (e.g., "the", "and").
* Computed **Cosine Similarity** to find top 5 closest movies.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Dataset from Kaggle

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your Jupyter Notebook / Colab.
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to the appropriate path.
3. Run all cells to process the data and build the recommendation system.
4. Call `recommend('Movie Name')` to get top 5 similar movies.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output

```python
recommend('Life of Pi')
```

**Output**:

```
Cast Away  
The Beach  
The Thin Red Line  
The Book Thief  
Seven Years in Tibet  
```

## ðŸ“¦ Future Improvements

* Deploy as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
* Add a user-based collaborative filtering module.
* Integrate movie posters and trailers using TMDB API.
* Improve performance using TF-IDF or deep learning embeddings.
